# Clevo-NB50TK1-Hackintosh-OC

### This repo includes the OpenCore EFI with all the fixes for NB50TK1 on Big Sur.

This repo can also be used for macOS Catalina.

Tested on:

Model | NB50TK1
------------- | ---------------
CPU | Intel Core i3-8100
iGPU | Intel UHD Graphics 630
dGPU | NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti (disabled)
RAM | 16 GB DDR4
SSD | 128 GB M.2 (SATA)
WiFi | IntelÂ® Dualband-Wireless-AC 3168
Software | macOS 10.15.7 Catalina (Big Sur going to be tested soon)

## What works?

* Battery
* TrackPad
* Brightness control
* Function keys
* Sleep
* Keyboard backlight control incl. RGB
* Sound (incl. audio jack)
* WiFi
* Bluetooth
* Full iGPU acceleration (UHD 630)
* HDMI (partially)

### How to get function keys and KBD backlight control working

Download [ClevoService](https://github.com/FreeJHack/ClevoService), install `com.fjhk.ClevoService.agent.plist` into `/Library/LaunchAgents/` and inject `ClevoService.kext` into `/Library/Extensions/`

## What doesn't work?

* dGPU: Since Pascal GPUs have no support since Mojave, it's disabled. By disabling and setting the card into D3 in ACPI, the lowest power state a device can support, the GPU will barely consume any power, so battery life should be improved as a result.
* Mini DisplayPort as it's directly conntected to the dGPU
* HDMI Hotplug: This is an issue, we are currently looking into. To get around this, HDMI has to be plugged in during bootup.
* Trackpad has no Magic TrackPad 2 emulation

## How to install

Download this repo and place the EFI folder into your EFI Partition... That's it.

## How to Install macOS Big Sur

There are two ways you can make a USB installer:

1. Have a working install of macOS, download the Installer from the App Store, then make a bootable Installer with `createinstallmedia` by using this command in Terminal `sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Big\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume`

2. If you are using Windows, use [macrecovery.py](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/winblows-install.html) from the offical OpenCore release package.

After you made a bootable Installer, copy the EFI folder to the EFI partition and install as usual. After the installation, mount the EFI of the installed OS and copy the EFI folder to its partition.
